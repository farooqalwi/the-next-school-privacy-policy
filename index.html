    <h3>11. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
      policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and
      conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California
      consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
      those individuals with whom it is being shared and to comply with this policy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our
      website;</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.4. Users can change their personal information by emailing us at <a
        href="mailto:info@thenextschool.com.pk">info@thenextschool.com.pk</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
    <br>
    <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser
      mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do
      not want to be tracked.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your
      data, and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask
      us:</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.1. What personal information do we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.5. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the category of any other
      company we sold it to. We will inform you of that fact if we have not sold your personal information.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business purpose, along with the
      category of any other company we shared it with.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times in a rolling
      twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may be limited to the personal
      information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the personal information we
      hold about you as of the date of your request from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In
      some cases, deletion may be accomplished through the de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete
      your personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal information to
      operate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal information to any third
      parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. However, under some
      circumstances, a transfer of personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without
      monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of your Data and
      can request disclosure or deletion at any time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you
      may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services that require the usage of your personal
      information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s)by email: <a
        href="mailto:info@thenextschool.com.pk">info@thenextschool.com.pk/</a></p>

    <p>Terms:</p>
    <p>
      Please read the terms and conditions carefully in the event of clicking the “accept” button the user is
      deemed to have assented to all the conditions that have been subscribed by the service provider or by
      their agents or assessors and aides the term wherever shall include but not limited to the
      aforementioned and the expression in no terms may be treated to deem an exhaustive list wherein the
      service provider is free to enter more clauses into the already mentioned clauses by insertion of an
      addendum to the existing terms and conditions.<br><br><br>

      That the acceptance of the terms and conditions is the user’s willful intention to commit to all of the
      conditions set forth by the provider and at no point can the user be deemed to not having assented to a
      particular term and once the user adheres to the terms it is therefore deemed fit that the user has
      assented to every term.<br><br>

      That the material available on the portal is the sole property of the provider and the provider has the
      sole discretion in deciphering which material to levy a charge for and which materials will be provided
      without an additional charge.<br><br>

      By signing up on the portal the user understands that its data would be shared by the provider with its
      partners which will include but not limit to its partners and other platforms where ever it is deemed
      necessary by the user in similar areas such as the portal which has been signed up for.
      That access to the portal is for one user per login/ID and counterfeiting of the material is strictly
      prohibited.<br><br>

      That the user has deemed to have understood that by signing up they are treated as a student of the
      particular portal and specifically of the material that they are accessing at the given point in time and in
      no way can they act as an assessor?<br><br>

      That the provider does not have any agency /principal relationship with the user.<br><br>

      That the service provider is in no way responsible for the performance of the user/student in the exams
      that the user wishes to take or is studying for as this is a platform that provides mere guidance and is
      not an assessment body where the performance of the user can be assessed or is benchmarked against
      any accredited boards or universities.<br><br>

      That the provider is within the geographical limits of Pakistan and hence the territorial limits of Pakistan
      shall form the jurisdiction of courts of competent jurisdiction in Pakistan.<br><br>

      That the user has signed is deemed to have accepted the portal as an ancillary body to formal education
      and in form is the provider asserting the portal as a substitute to the formal channels of education and
      hence, not a body to provide a measure on the user’s progress.<br><br>

      That the user has attended sessions on the portals is no measure of the academic performance of the
      user and the provider is in no way or form responsible for the performance of the user in any
      competitive examination.<br><br>

      That if a user is under the legal consenting age which is eighteen years in Pakistan it is deemed that the
      access has been provided through the supervision of a parent/guardian and the terms have not only
      been understood by the user but in this case have been understood by the supervisor of the user.<br><br>

      That the user has no right to challenge the method of teaching of a particular instructor and how an
      instructor conducts the sessions is the sole discretion of the instructor.<br><br>

      That the subscription fee charged by the provider is subject to a legitimate refund policy which has a
      time-lapse of 40 days.<br><br>

      That the refund is only available to the user who has not been suspended due to a violation of any of
      the terms and conditions or any disciplinary action has not been taken against them by the provider.<br><br>

      If there is any breach in the terms and conditions or any other disciplinary breach that may take place
      on part of the user the provider has the sole discretion to suspend/terminate the user from the portal
      with immediate effect without any prior notice/warning in the event of a serious breach.<br><br>

      That the constitution of a serious breach is the sole discretion of the provider and the user has no right
      to question the provider’s criterion.<br><br>

      That the data of other users and the privacy of all the users are paramount to the provider and any
      attempt to tamper with the cyber security of the portal will be deemed a criminal offense as envisaged
      in the Cyber Crimes Act 2020.<br><br>

      If the user’s stipulated period is ending and the user wishes to access the material of the provider, the
      user must pay the continuing stipulation or join one of the crash courses to obtain continual access.<br><br>

      If a user indulges in the practice of sharing any banned content or content not fit for the purpose, the
      provider has a zero-tolerance policy and the violators shall be suspended from the forum immediately.<br><br>

      In the event of any spamming by the user, the provider would by way of a unilateral action terminate
      the account of the user without allowing the user to re-enter under any circumstance.<br><br>

      That the terms envisaged above are in countenance with the laws governing the fair usage policy and
      aim to protect the rights and privileges of all involved.
